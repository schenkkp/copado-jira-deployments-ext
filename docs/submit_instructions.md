| Solution Description | The **Jira Cloud Deployments Automation** extension notifies Jira Cloud with deployment information post-promotion using the [Jira Cloud Deployments API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest/api-group-deployments/). This extension enhances the integration between Copado and Jira Cloud by automatically updating Jira with the latest deployment status and details immediately after a promotion deployment is executed. This ensures that the project management and tracking systems are seamlessly synchronized with the actual deployment activities, improving visibility and traceability across development and operations teams.
